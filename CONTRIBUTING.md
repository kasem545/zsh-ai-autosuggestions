# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing.

This project values **clarity, restraint, and correctness** over speed or feature count.
Thoughtful contributions are welcome at all stages, including design discussions and early drafts.

---

## Ways to Contribute

You can contribute by:

- Improving shell integrations (zsh, bash, fish)
- Designing or refining agent architecture
- Implementing LLM backend adapters
- Working on heuristics and intent prediction
- Improving performance or latency
- Enhancing safety and validation logic
- Writing documentation or examples
- Opening design discussions or proposals

Code is not the only valuable contribution.

## Before You Start

Please read the README and roadmap to understand:

- what this project is trying to do
- what it explicitly avoids doing
- the philosophy behind silence, confidence, and control

If unsure, open an issue to discuss your idea first.

## Contribution Principles

All contributions should aim to:

- Predict intent, not over-explain
- Preserve user control at all times
- Avoid intrusive behavior
- Keep suggestions optional and read-only
- Prefer correctness over cleverness

Features that add noise, automation without consent, or unnecessary complexity are unlikely to be accepted.

---

## Pull Requests

Guidelines for PRs:

- Keep PRs focused and scoped
- One logical change per PR when possible
- Explain *why* the change is needed, not just *what*
- Draft PRs are welcome
- Refactors should be justified with clarity or performance gains

PRs that introduce breaking behavior must clearly explain trade-offs.

---

## Issues & Discussions

Issues are encouraged for:

- Design questions
- Architectural proposals
- Edge cases
- Safety concerns
- Performance bottlenecks

This is a thinking-heavy project.  
Good questions are valued as much as good code.

---

## Code Style & Quality

- Favor readability over clever tricks
- Avoid unnecessary abstractions
- Comment intent, not obvious syntax
- Assume future contributors are peers, not beginners

---

## Code of Conduct

Be respectful, technical, and direct.

Disagreements are expected.  
Personal attacks, dismissiveness, or condescension are not tolerated.

---

## Final Note

This project is intentionally opinionated.

If you enjoy working on tools that:
- stay out of the way
- respect expert users
- solve hard UX problems quietly

You are very welcome here.
